###### My own test code for courses taken at San Diego Mesa College.

## About
I am taking online courses in PHP, JavaScript, and jQuery. This is a repository for all of my extra code created to help me better understand the material being covered.

## Changes
**2/8/2016** - Added "Variable Type Test" php code for course WEBD166. I wanted to know more about how switching variable types worked in PHP. I also wanted to know what would happen when I added integers to strings of numbers.
